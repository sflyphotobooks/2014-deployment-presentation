      Introduction
      Galleon Project Setup
      Describe git
      Describe git flow
      Describe our usage of git flow
      Continuous Integration
      None of this works without a way to test code as early and often as possible
      Running all unit tests against every push to github
      Tests can't have heisenbugs
      Creating release artifacts of every feature branch
      Deployments
      Throwing builds at beta
      Every feature branch that passes unit tests should be deployed for functional testing
      Emails to team upon deployment
      Executing test suite against each build
      Updating beta when develop changes
      Current Deployment Pipeline
      Soon Deployment Pipeline
      Point out issues with git flow and continuous delivery
      Reconciling manual code review step with merging into develop and retesting everything
      Reconciling manual QE testing and automation against develop with multiple merges into develop
      Reconciling PM acceptance testing against develop with multiple merges into develop
      Next steps
      Commenting on pull requests
      Easing out production deployments
      Running more tests on better environments

      <h2>Galleon Development Workflow</h2>
      <h3>Git Flow - <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One branch <code>master</code> tracks what is production-ready</li>
        <li>One branch <code>develop</code> tracks the current active line of development</li>
        <li>Many "feature" branches track specific user stories
          <ul>
            <li>Feature branches prevent in-progress work from interfering with QE and PM acceptance</li>
            <li>They are a short-lived sandbox so atomic units of work can be merged into <code>develop</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Galleon Development Workflow (cont)</h2>
      <h3>A developer's daily work pattern with git flow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><code>git pull</code> to update my local <code>develop</code> branch with the team's merged work</li>
        <li><code>git checkout -b my-next-user-story</code> to create a feature branch for my upcoming work</li>
        <li><em>code, code, code, code, test, code, existential crisis, test...</em></li>
        <li><code>git add -A && git commit -m "All done!"</code> to stage my feature work</li>
        <li><code>git push -u origin my-cool-feature</code> to publish my feature branch on github</li>
        <li>Browse to github and open a "pull request" to start my code review</li>
        <li><em>review, update, update, review, debate, accept pull request</em></li>
        <li>Merge <code>my-next-user-story</code> into <code>develop</code> so we can deploy, test, and accept the story</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Galleon Development Workflow (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Benefits of git flow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating patch releases for production issues is trivial because daily work doesn't affect <code>master</code></li>
        <li>Creation of QA-able builds for beta deployments is consistent because only fully-implemented user stories are merged into <code>develop</code></li>
        <li>It's easy to work on multiple user stories because each story is isolated in its own feature branch</li>
        <li>We can use pull requests to perform code reviews before code is merged into <code>develop</code></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h4 style="margin-top:200px; text-align: center;">We now have a rapid cycle from feature branch to develop, but how do we turn that into a build?</h4>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Jenkins polls github and will build each branch that changes</li>
        <li>The build job will compile, minify, and run our unit test suite across our supported browser matrix</li>
        <li>Developers must link to the successful Jenkins build for their feature branch during a pull request</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Continuous Integration (cont)</h2>
      <h3>What does CI buy us?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All unit tests and static code checks must demonstratably pass before work can be merged</li>
        <li>"It passes on my box!" is no longer an issue</li>
        <li>Code changes require unit testing to pass code review</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Deployments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>At the point that the pull request has been accepted, we can assert that:
          <ul>
            <li>All unit tests pass on our CI server</li>
            <li>Code is lint-free and passes our other static analyses</li>
            <li>The other developers on the team agree with the new feature's implementation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Merging the feature branch into <code>develop</code> triggers a new build, with the checks and tests repeated</li>
        <li>Successful builds of the <code>develop</code> branch are packaged and deployed to artifactory and beta</li>
        <li>Since Galleon doesn't include Java code, we can deploy at-will (~5-10x daily)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Deployments (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Why deploy more frequently to beta?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"D'oh" moments don't hold up the team</li>
        <li>We can test smaller changes without worrying about breaking the app for hours</li>
        <li>We can iterate with QE and PM over intended behavior and fixing bugs on a "real" server</li>
        <li>It's possible to merge, deploy, test, and accept work within minutes</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h4 style="margin-top:200px; text-align: center;">Deploying often is nice and all, but where are you taking this?</h4>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deploy feature branches to beta</li>
        <li>Run automated functional tests against deployed feature branches</li>
        <li>Swapping out the "primary" version of the application in a given environment</li>
        <li>CI integration with team</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Next Steps (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Deploying all feature branches to internal environments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The "primary" version of the app is always http://beta|dev|stage.shutterfly.com/pb/</li>
        <li>Feature branches that pass the CI build end up at http://foo.shutterfly.com/pb/builds/x
          <ul>
            <li>We can then run integration tests against a build on beta without interrupting other development</li>
            <li>This lets us require the integration tests to pass before merging the feature branch, raising confidence in the build</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Next Steps (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Running automated tests against deployed feature branches</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Once each feature branch has their own url on beta, we can test them in isolation</li>
        <li>Running a test suite against the deployment raise confidence about code changes</li>
        <li>If the deployment and test suite are fast enough, we can require proof of success in a pull request</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Next Steps (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Manually updating the primary deployed version</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Since deployments are now decoupled from the version hosted at the canonical url, we can validate a build on-site</li>
        <li>When a build passes testing, acceptance, and is ready to "go live", we swap the symlink for the primary version to our new version</li>
        <li>Rolling back deploys becomes the simple process of swapping the symlink back to the old primary version</li>
        <li>Once this mechanism is in place, we can phase-in production deployments through the load balancer</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h2>Next Steps (cont)</h2>
      <h3>Integration between CI and team</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If Jenkins is now managing the entire build and deployment process, we can add tooling to tighten the cycle
          <ul>
            <li>It can send out emails to the team upon successful deployments</li>
            <li>It can automatically comment on pull requests once the build and deployment jobs run</li>
            <li>It can continue to comment on pull requests if the codebase changes, or <code>develop</code> changes upstream</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
